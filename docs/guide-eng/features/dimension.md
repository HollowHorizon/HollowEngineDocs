# Narrator's Dimension

HollowEngine adds its own dimension. It is not tied to the current world, meaning you can, for example, place a chest there, put diamonds in it, delete the world, later create a new world, enter this dimension, and the chest with diamonds will still be there.

You can use it for any purpose, but the original idea is that if you want to create a cutscene with an environment for a build or a small location, but you don't have the ability to add it to the main world as a structure, you can use this dimension for that.

> To enter the dimension, take the Portal Item from the `Hollow Engine` mod tab in the creative menu.
> Then right-click on any block. To return, also right-click on any block.
