# Welcome to the HollowEngine Wiki
HollowEngine is an advanced engine for creating diverse content for Minecraft.

## Information
With HollowEngine, you can significantly enhance the gameplay on your modpack or map. Currently, the engine allows you to:
1) Edit all types of vanilla recipes.
2) Create NPCs, cutscenes, dialogues, and interact with the world and player groups.
3) (*For advanced users*) Write small add-ons for the game, add items, blocks, mobs, dimensionsâ€”basically, everything that Forge allows.

## Getting Started
First and foremost, I recommend starting with the [installation](install.md) of the mod. <br>
Practically everything you need can be done using scripts in the [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) language. If you are not familiar with programming in general, we recommend gaining some understanding of the topic first: read a couple of books, take courses, watch tutorials on YouTube. It's much harder to navigate without basic knowledge. <br>
For a more in-depth introduction to scripting, you can explore the chapter [Scripts: Introduction](scripting/introduction.md).

## Help
For any questions regarding the mod, feel free to reach out to the [Discord](https://discord.gg/qKpPhkwGCY) mod server. There, you can also find some ready-made scripts, share your own developments, or suggest a couple of new features for the mod!
