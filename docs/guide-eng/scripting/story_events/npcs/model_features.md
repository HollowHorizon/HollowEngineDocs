# Configuring Character Models

In this section, we specifically cover configuring the model in BlockBench/Blender, not the script.

## Support for Items in Hands

To display items in the hands of the character model, add groups/bones with the corresponding names in the desired locations:
> - `RightHandItem` - For the right hand.
> - `LeftHandItem` - For the left hand.

You can also use this method to animate items in animations, such as sword battles or taking items out of pockets.
